# personal_website
A personal website that I want to create as an online resume that can also double as a project to show others how my webdevelopment skillz are. I think I will go with using angular and node, since that is what we are learning in class. 

### things to do
 - actually build the site
 - come up with a basic wire frame for how I want the site to be
 - CODE IT
 - like seriously, you need to do something
 - database infrastructure for a login part? try to use mongo???
 - definitely use node, express, mongo (MEAN stack)
